# **BFPT Symbolic Regression**

This repository demonstrates how the **Banach Fixed Point Theorem (BFPT)** can be used in **symbolic regression** to derive the **general half-life formula** for particle decay using Python. Traditionally, differential equations serve as the foundation for modeling physical phenomena, but this novel approach highlights how **metric spaces and contraction mappings** can serve as a **complementary tool** in mathematical modeling.

## 🔹 **Origins of the Discovery**
The inspiration for applying **BFPT** to derive new symbolic regression formulas emerged from email exchanges with **Dr. Rainer Weiss**. The core method presented here was used to derive a **general half-life formula for particle decay**, which Dr. Weiss found novel and encouraged further exploration. Notably, he thought this approach hinted at a possible **unification of particle decay detected under different interactions**. This repository is an outgrowth of those conversations.

## ⚡ **How It Works**
### **Step-by-Step Method**
1️⃣ **Define a Metric Space:** Represent data as points in a complete metric space with a well-defined distance function.

2️⃣ **Identify a Contraction Mapping:** Explore potential mappings that satisfy the contraction property.

3️⃣ **Verify Contraction Condition:** Ensure the mapping meets the contraction criteria, guaranteeing convergence.

4️⃣ **Apply Banach Fixed Point Theorem:** Iterate the contraction mapping until a stable solution is reached.

5️⃣ **Derive a Closed-Form Formula:** Express the fixed point as a symbolic equation to reveal the general law.

6️⃣ **Ensure the Formula Generalizes:** Verify that the derived equation holds for all points in the metric space.

## **📌 Running the Script**
### **Current Implementation**
The **Python script** included in this repository is **purely symbolic**, meaning it does **not fit data** but instead **provides an explicit derivation** of the half-life formula using a contraction mapping.

### **Steps to Run:**
1️⃣ **Clone the repository**:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/BFPT-Symbolic-Regression.git
```
2️⃣ **Run the script**:
```sh
python src/bfpt_half_life.py
```
3️⃣ **Observe the Output (Symbolic Derivation):**
```
🔹 **Symbolic Derivation using BFPT** 🔹

📌 **General Exponential Decay Formula:**
   P(t) = P0 * α^(t / β)

📌 **General Half-Life Formula:**
   t_1/2 = (ln(2) / ln(1/α)) * β
```

## 🔭 **Planned Future Updates**
This repository is **an initial demonstration** of BFPT-based symbolic regression. Future updates will include:
1. **Data Ingestion Feature** – Users will be able to **input a dataset (CSV)** containing **X and Y values**, where Y is the target variable.
2. **Automated Contraction Mapping Discovery** – Instead of manually selecting contraction mappings, the next phase will **automate the search** for mappings that satisfy the contraction condition, ensuring a **valid fixed point** exists.
3. **Generalization to Other Scientific Domains** – The method will be extended beyond half-life calculations to **thermodynamics, machine learning, general relativity, and quantum mechanics**.
4. **Comparisons with Differential Equations** – Investigate how **BFPT-based symbolic regression** compares to classical **differential equation-based** approaches in physics.
